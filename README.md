## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **💻 Node.js & npm:** Ensure Node.js (v14 or higher) and npm are installed on your machine.
  - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **☁️ Google Cloud Account:** Access to Google Cloud Console to set up Google Drive API.

## 🚀 Installation

1. **📥 Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/certificate-sender.git
   cd certificate-sender

   ```

2. **📦 Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

### 1. Google Drive API Setup

To enable Google Drive integration, follow these steps:

#### Create a Google Cloud Project

- Navigate to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- Create a new project or select an existing one.

#### Enable Google Drive API

- Go to **APIs & Services > Library**.
- Search for **Google Drive API** and enable it.

#### Create Service Account Credentials

- Navigate to **APIs & Services > Credentials**.
- Click **Create Credentials > Service Account**.
- Fill in the required details and proceed.
- After creating, select the service account and navigate to **Keys**.
- Click **Add Key > Create New Key** in JSON format.
- Download the `credentials.json` file and place it in the project root.

#### Share Google Drive Folder with Service Account

- In Google Drive, create a folder (e.g., `HackMoral6.0 Certificates`).
- Share this folder with the service account's email (found in `credentials.json`) with **Editor** permissions.

### 2. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root to store sensitive information:

```env
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-email-password-or-app-specific-password
CERTIFICATES_FOLDER_ID=your-google-drive-folder-id
```

- **EMAIL_USER:** Your Gmail address used to send emails.
- **EMAIL_PASS:** Your Gmail password or an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) if using two-factor authentication.
- **CERTIFICATES_FOLDER_ID:** The ID of the Google Drive folder where certificates will be uploaded. You can find this in the folder's URL (`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/YOUR_FOLDER_ID`).

**_Note:_** Ensure that `.env` and `credentials.json` are added to `.gitignore` to prevent sensitive data from being pushed to version control.

### 3. Project Structure

Ensure your project directory looks like this:

```
certificate-sender/
├── certificates/               # 🎓 Generated certificates
├── fonts/
│   └── Singel.ttf              # 🔤 Your custom font file

```

## 🛠️ Usage

### 1. Prepare Participant Data

Ensure your Excel file (`participants.xlsx`) is formatted correctly:

| Name          | Email             |
| ------------- | ----------------- |
| Alice Johnson | alice@example.com |
| Bob Smith     | bob@example.com   |
| ...           | ...               |

- **Headers:** The first row should contain headers like `Name` and `Email`.
- **Sheet Name:** By default, the script reads from `Sheet1`. Ensure your data is on this sheet or update the script accordingly.

### 2. Generate Certificates

Run the certificate generation script to create personalized PDFs:

```bash
node generateCertificates.js
```

- This will create a `certificates/` directory containing PDFs named after each participant (e.g., `Alice_Johnson.pdf`).

### 3. Upload Certificates to Google Drive

Ensure that the `credentials.json` is correctly placed and the `CERTIFICATES_FOLDER_ID` is set in the `.env` file.

Run the upload script:

```bash
node uploadToDrive.js
```

### 4. Send Emails

Run the email sending script to distribute certificates:

```bash
node sendEmails.js
```

- Each participant will receive an email with a link to download their certificate.

### 5. Automate the Entire Workflow

For a streamlined process, use the master script:

```bash
node index.js
```

- This script will:
  1. **Generate** personalized certificates.
  2. **Upload** them to Google Drive.
  3. **Send** personalized emails with download links.

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **❌ Certificate Not Found Error:**
  - Ensure that `generateCertificates.js` has successfully created all certificates in the `certificates/` directory before running the upload and email scripts.

- **☁️ Google Drive Upload Issues:**
  - Verify that the service account has the necessary permissions to access and upload files to the specified Google Drive folder.
  - Ensure that `credentials.json` is correctly placed and that the `CERTIFICATES_FOLDER_ID` is accurate.

- **📧 Email Sending Issues:**
  - Confirm that your email credentials in the `.env` file are correct.
  - If using Gmail, ensure that [App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) are set up if two-factor authentication is enabled.

- **🔤 Font Embedding Issues:**
  - Ensure that the font file (`Singel.ttf`) is correctly placed in the `fonts/` directory.
  - Verify that the font name in the script matches the actual font file.

- **📊 Excel Reading Issues:**
  - Ensure that the Excel file (`participants.xlsx`) is correctly formatted with headers matching the script's expectations (`Name`, `Email`).
  - Verify the sheet name (`Sheet1`) or update it in the scripts if different.
